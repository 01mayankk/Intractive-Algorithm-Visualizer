# Interactive Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing various algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. It is built with React and uses modern web technologies to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features

*   **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, and Radix Sort.
*   **Searching Algorithms**: Visualize Linear Search and Binary Search.
*   **Graph Algorithms**: Visualize Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
*   **Interactive Controls**: Add nodes and edges to the graph, select start and goal nodes, and control the animation speed.
*   **Real-time Visualization**: See the algorithms in action as they are animated on the screen.
